SPONGE
======

Some experiments with Canvas and JavaScript, loosely taking the form of a game.

HOW DO I PLAY?
--------------
Well, the gameplay is still evolving. At the moment, you are a blob of color
(the titular "sponge"). You can move around with the mouse, but you're limited
to the lower chunk of the screen. Colored lines fall from the "sky." To gain
points, absorb lines that are the same color as you. As you absorb more, you'll
notice yourself "filling up" -- once you're full, you'll grow in diameter and
your score multiplier will be increased!  Rinse and repeat... FOR ETERNITY. (Or
until you get bored -- you can't die yet.)


WILL IT GET BETTER?
-------------------
Probably!


WHAT ELSE ARE YOU PLANNING TO ADD?
----------------------------------
A lot!
